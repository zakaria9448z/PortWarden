## Installation

To install PortWarden, clone the repository and install the required packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zakaria9448z/PortWarden.git
cd PortWarden
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/zakaria9448z/PortWarden/releases) section. Execute the downloaded file to start using PortWarden.

## Usage

To run PortWarden, simply execute the script with the target IP address. Hereâ€™s the basic command structure:

```bash
python portwarden.py <target_ip>
```

### Options

- `-p` or `--ports`: Specify a range of ports to scan (default scans all).
- `-t` or `--threads`: Set the number of threads for scanning (default is 100).
- `-o` or `--output`: Save results to a specified JSON file.

### Example Command

```bash
python portwarden.py 192.168.1.1 -p 1-1000 -t 200 -o results.json
```

This command scans ports 1 to 1000 on the target IP address using 200 threads and saves the output to `results.json`.

## Example Output

Upon successful execution, PortWarden will display open ports in real-time. The output may look something like this:

```
Scanning target: 192.168.1.1
Open port: 22 (SSH)
Open port: 80 (HTTP)
Open port: 443 (HTTPS)
```

The results saved in `results.json` will be structured as follows:

```json
{
  "target": "192.168.1.1",
  "open_ports": [
    {
      "port": 22,
      "service": "SSH"
    },
    {
      "port": 80,
      "service": "HTTP"
    },
    {
      "port": 443,
      "service": "HTTPS"
    }
  ]
}
```
